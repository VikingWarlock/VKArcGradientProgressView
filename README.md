##Usage
####1.import the VKArcProgressBar.h
	#import "VKArcProgressBar.h"

####2.create a object
	VKArcProgressBar *progress=[VKArcProgressBar alloc]init];

####3.customize

---

#####Set the colors
	@property(nonatomic,copy)NSArray<UIColor*> *gradientColorList;

If your don't set this ,you will get the default colors pattern

	progress.gradientColorList=@[[UIColor redColor],[UIColor yellowColor],[[UIColor greenColor]];

---
#####Set the width
	@property(nonatomic,assign)CGFloat width;
Default is 8

---

#####Set the maximum and minimum value of this progress
	@property(nonatomic,assign)CGFloat minData;
	@property(nonatomic,assign)CGFloat maxData;
Default is 0 and 80

---

#####Set the data
	-(void)setdata:(CGFloat)data andAnimated:(BOOL)animate;

The parameter data should `less` than the maximum value and `greater` than the minimum value,otherwise you may not get what you want.

---

#####Set the animate time
	@property(nonatomic,assign)CGFloat animatedTime;
if `animatedTime <= 0`, it `won't move` smoothly!

---

#####Set the angle
	@property(nonatomic,assign)CGFloat startAngle;
	@property(nonatomic,assign)CGFloat endAngle;

---

#####Set the location of each gradient stop
	@property(nonatomic,copy)NSArray<NSNumber *> *customLocations;
value in the range `[0,1]`,Default may not look good.The demo use 0.2,0.5,0.8
